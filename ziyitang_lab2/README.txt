Input should be in a file. The format should be as following:
5 (0 3 200 3) (0 9 500 2) (0 20 500 1) (100 1 100 3) (100 100 500 1)
Each process is represented by a tuple of 4 numbers with parentheses.

To build my program, please run command "g++ lab2.cpp"
To run my program, please run command "./a.out <Input File>"
If you want to see the verbose, please run command "./a.out --verbose <Input File>"  

Please make sure that the file "random-numbers" exists before running my program.
